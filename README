{X}fm is a family of document formatting programmes 
which read a common source language to produce output 
in HTML, PostScript, or ASCII formatted text.  The 
{X}fm language provides for the definition of variables, 
inclusion of files and preformatted material 
(encapsulated PostScript, or plain text), table 
generation and formatting of the text with optional 
justification, indexing, and multiple column support.

{X}fm allows an author the ability to maintain one copy 
of document source with the ability to generate multiple 
output formats from the single source.  In addition, 
{X}fm also provides the ability to share document sections 
and images between documents which can significantly 
reduce the maintenance effort when supporting related 
documents.
