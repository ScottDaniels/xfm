This directory contains the basic setup to build a docker image that can be used
to run {X}fm.  The build process clones the {X}fm repo from github, as well as 
needed support tools (mk and fig2dev), builds {X}fm binaries, then creates the final
docker image.   

Please refer to the xfm.ksh script for an example of how to run {X}fm tools from
the container.   The Makefile and master.mk are sample files that can be used in 
a document directory with the containerised {X}fm.   The container also includes
the gnu make utility if you prefer that over mk.  No make examples are given.
