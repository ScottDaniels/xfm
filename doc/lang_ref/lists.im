.h2 Lists
&x supports two different styles of lists: bullet lists, and term or definition lists. 
Bullet lists are simple lists with each item in the list marked with a special character, 
where definition lists divide the current column into two reserving the left column for 
terms and the right column for the formatted definition text. 
The following paragraphs describe each of these lists and the commands that are used to 
create and manipulate them. 


.h3 Bullet lists
A bullet list is created using the &ital(begin list) &c(bl) command, followed by one or more
&ital(list item) &c(li) commands, and is finalised with the &ital(end list) &c(el) command.
The &ital(begin list) command optionally accepts the character to use as the bullet character, and
the font and size to use for the bullets.
The following is the syntax for the &ital(begin list) command:
.sp

.sp
.sf &litfont
.nf
 .bl [bullet-char] [f=font] [s=size]
.fo
.sf &textfont
.sp
Where:
&indent .sp 1
.bd .75i &ditext
.di bullet-char : Is the character that is to be generated as the bullet when a
&ital(list item) command is encountered. If the character cannot easily be entered 
into the source file using the keyboard, the notation &lit(\nnn) can be used where
&lit(nnn) is the &stress(decimal) value of the character.
If not supplied, an asterisk (*) is used.
.sp
.di f=font : Supplies the name of the font that should be used to render the 
bullet character from. If not supplied, then the current font is used. 
.sp
.di s=size : Specifies the size (in either points or inches) that should be used
when rendering the bullets.  
.ed
&uindent
.sp
The &ital(list item) &c(li) command is used for each list item to be placed in the list
and the &ital(end list) &c(el) command is used to end the list.  
When the &ital(list item) command is encountered, &x will automatically add a break to the 
formatted text such that the text following the &ital(list item) command will begin at the 
left margin. If the user desires the list items to be separated with a blank line, the 
&ital(list item) command should be preceded with a &ital(space) command. 

.sp
.gv fig
.dv blfig &_fig
The source for a  simple bullet list is contained in figure &blfig.
The font used is the &ital(Dingbats) font and the letter 'l' (lowercase L)
cooresponds to a filled circle in that font.

When generating HTML 
output, the user should be aware that most browsers automatically indent for a list.
The list item character, and size parameters are also ignored by the &lit(hfm) 
formatter as browsers do not accept the character from the user when rendering a list.


.h3 A definition list
A definition list is a list of terms and definitions. When started, a portion of the current column
is reserved for the terms with the remainder of the column used to format the text of the definition.
.gv fig
(Refer to the example in figure &_fig for an illustration of a definition list.)
The begin definition list command &c(bd)  is used to start a definition list and accepts parameters
that define the width of the term area, the font that terms are to be written using, and  an 
optional automatic term generation parameter. 
The &ital(begin definition list) command has the syntax:
.sp
.sf &litfont
.st [ &textsize 2 - ]
.sf &litfont
.nf
 .bd <termsize> [<font>] [a=x] [f=fmt]
.fo
.sf &textfont
.st &textsize
.sf &textfont
.sp
Where:
&indent .sp 1
.bd .65i &ditext
.di termsize : is the size (in inches or points) that is reserved for each 
term.  
.sp
.di font : is the name of the font that should be used for the terms ( &lit(pfm) only).
.sp
.di a=x : Causes automatic generation of terms where &ital(x) is the starting term. &ital(x) 
may be either a character or a number. If &lit(a=a) is specified, then terms are generated
&lit(a, b, c) and so forth. If &lit(a=3) is specified, then terms are generated &lit(3, 4, 5) 
and so on. 
.sp
.di f=fmt : Allows a format string to be supplied when automatic term generation is used. 
The format string is a &bold(C) programming language &lit(printf) format string. If 
generating a numbered list, the format string &lit(%2d]) could be used to align the 
values and to add a right parenthesis to each term.
.ed
&uindent
.sp
Once  a definition list has been started, the &ital(definition item) command &c(di) introduces a new term into the list.
When this command is encountered, the previous term is completed and an implied 
&ital(break) command &c(br) is processed. 
The term is assumed to consist of all tokens appearing after the command up to the 
next newline character or a lone colon (:) which indicates the end of parameters. 
The usual syntax is:
.sp
.st [ &textsize 2 - ]
.sf &litfont
.nf
  .di term ^: First text of definition.
  .di term2 
      No colon needed if definition on 
      new line. Indention optional.
.fo
.sf &textfont
.st &textsize
.sp
It must be noted that the colon (which implies the end of the &ital(definition item) command)
must be  separated from the term, and first token of the definition, by white space. 
&x will treat all tokens until the next &ital(definition item) command, or the 
&ital(end definition list) command as a part of the definition. 

.sp
Definition lists are generally intended for single word terms (no spaces), and
if a term with spaces is used results may not be as expected.
When generating HTML, long terms are wrapped by the browser that displays the list, 
but the width of the term area may suffer.  &x can only suggest to the browser the size of 
the term and definition areas and thus the resulting output might be different than expected. 
When generating PostScript and RTF, &x will also wrap terms, however the term width indicated
is respected which could cause the word to 'bleed' into the regular text. 
.sp
&x makes an exception for single word terms which are wider than the defined term field size. 
When a wide term is encountered, it is allowed to bleed into the text space, but &x will start
the definition text one line below the line that the term was started on.  This allows for 
definition lists where the majority of terms are of a similar size, without the need to set the 
term size based on the largest term. 
The &ital(heel-hook) term in the example below illustrates this effect.


.sp
.h4 Definition list example: 
.gv fig
.dv dl_fig &_fig
The  source code in figure &dl_fig illustrates the three commands needed to create a definition list. The 
resulting formatted output is also presented. 
The code creates a list with a term area that is three-quarters of an inch wide. Terms are 
rendered in Helevetica-Bold font.

Had the &ital(begin definition list) command been given the 
parameter &lit(a=1), then the terms would have been automatically 
generated starting with one (1). When generating a list, the &ital(definition item) command
acts much like the &ital(list item) command and causes the next sequential term to be 
placed into the term area. When generating an automatically termed list, any terms 
that are supplied on the &ital(definition item) command are ignored, and thus the source code
tends to resemble:
.sp
.sf &litfont
.nf
 .di : Then turn left at the 2nd light.
.fo
.sf &textfont
.sp
Note that the colon is still necessary to terminate the &ital(definition item) command
unless the definition begins after a newline character.
