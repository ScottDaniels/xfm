This directory contains several 'startup' imbed files or templates
which attempt to provide some 'boiler plate' definitions. Some, like 
doc_start, or hfmstart, are more elaborate and failry complete setups
while there are smaller files like markdown which have a specific 
purpose and can be combined with others. 

This directory also contains a master mkfile which can be imported
into mkfiles in order to provide standard/basic rules for doc
generation (e.g. to generate a .pdf, do this with the same named
.xfm source).
