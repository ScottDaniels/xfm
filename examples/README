Examples
This directory contains some example documents that both serve as a set
of regression tests and to help understand the language and methods
of the {X}fm world better.   They aren't spell checked, and probably 
only contain minimally useful text.

These exampes are also simple complete documents which do not rely on 
any 'startup' macros.  The starup macros are nice for consistency between
documents, and eliminating some of the boiler plate mechanics, but 
when learning a new programming language it's sometimes best to 
have clear examples which don't hide anything.   

All of the exaples here should format with all formatters, though
not all of the deomonstrated features (e.g. floating margin) are
supported by all features.  The following are the input source 
files with an indication of the primary format type that the 
document is targeted for:

float_mar.xfm	Floating margins
mix_col.xfm		Mixed one and two column output (postscript)
two_col.xfm		Two column output
html_style.xfm	"Better" HTML output using the two_col source
